## Who I am?

Hello and welcome, I'm Durand ðŸ˜€,

I am passionate about emerging technologies ðŸš€ that are transforming the world around us.
My field of interest mainly focuses on embedded systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and robotics.
Each of these disciplines is fascinating in its own right, but what truly excites me is their powerful convergence into AIoT.

## My journey to IoT
From my beginnings in electronics, I understood that everything begins here, that electronics is the mother, the genesis of these technologies, redefining our future.
The foundations of innovation are born in integrated circuits, discrete components, and complex diagrams.

Over the years, I have had the chance to explore in-depth embedded systems and their ability to bring intelligent and autonomous devices to life.
IoT, on the other hand, has opened up a whole new universe of possibilities by connecting these devices to create intelligent, interconnected networks.
But what excites me the most is artificial intelligence, which breathes soul into these systems, giving them an unprecedented capacity for learning and adaptation.

## My goal
My goal is clear: to push the boundaries of AIoT by exploiting the full potential of electronics as a solid foundation.
By combining my passion for these technologies with my expertise in electronics, I strive to design innovative AIoT systems that transform how we live and work.

Electronics are the keystone that allows AIoT to shine and flourish fully.
Every circuit, every component, and every assembly matters because thatâ€™s where the magic of technological innovation lies.

If, like me, you believe that AIoT is the next major revolution and that electronics is the cornerstone of this transformation, I would be delighted to speak with you.
Together, we can shape a future where AI and IoT come together to create a more intelligent, sustainable, and connected world.
Do not hesitate to contact me to discuss your projects, ideas, or collaboration opportunities.
Together, let's write the next chapter in the AIoT story, driven by the power of electronics.

Too much talk about technology and my passion for electronics, IoT, and embedded systems. Do we agree?ðŸ¥²
